# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Project-Predicting-Credit-Card-Approval
This project uses a logistic regression model to predict credit card approval application by customers.While building this credit card predictor, we tackled some of the most widely-known preprocessing steps such as scaling, label encoding, and missing value imputation. We finished with some machine learning to predict if a person's application for a credit card would get approved or not given some information about that person.
